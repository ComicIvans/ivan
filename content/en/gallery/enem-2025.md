::event-about
The National Meeting of Mathematics Students (ENEM) is organized annually by the National Association of Mathematics Students (ANEM). Since its inception in Granada in 2000, ENEM has served as the annual meeting point for hundreds of students, offering a unique opportunity to network and share knowledge and experiences. Each year, it continues to grow and reach a wider audience, establishing itself as the flagship annual event within the student community of these fields.

<br/>

This conference is much more than an academic gathering; it is a platform for fostering synergies, inspiration, and motivation. Participants have the opportunity to delve into various areas of mathematics, statistics, and data science, while also promoting the importance of these disciplines in today’s society.

<br/>

Under the motto “From Granada to Spain and back to Granada”, the 26th ENEM marked the 25th anniversary of the event and was held in its birthplace during the summer of 2025. As the original host city and the heart of ENEM, Granada offers a comprehensive and enriching environment in terms of mathematics, culture, society, and industry.

My main responsibilities included managing the event budget, securing sponsors, coordinating with the entities participating in the Business and Entrepreneurship Forum, as well as planning and overseeing the overall logistics (accommodation, catering, venues, among other aspects).

<br/>

Thanks to the coordinated work and strong commitment of the organizing team, we contributed to the delivery of what was regarded as the best edition of the event to date, achieving record participation figures, a wide variety of activities, and a high level of overall attendee satisfaction.
