::event-about
The 4th CEEINA Training Conference (Student Council of the School of Engineering and Architecture of the University of Zaragoza) was held at the La Zarandilla Youth Hostel in the municipality of Munébrega (Zaragoza) from 16 to 21 September 2025.

<br/>

This conference consists of a stay at a hostel in the Aragonese region for 5 nights, in which only students participate. During the stay, in addition to the training sessions, a series of activities are carried out with the aim of fostering the most relaxed and favourable environment possible for consolidating knowledge in an enjoyable way.

::event-participation
I attended the conference as a **trainer**, delivering a total of four talks (two training sessions in two different groups):

<br/>

**IT tools in student representation**

In this training session, I shared a series of tools and tips related to information technology and cybersecurity, aimed at both personal use and the management of student associations and councils.

<br/>

**Complaint processing**

In this second talk, I addressed how to properly and efficiently process complaints received by the student council, including their classification and the protocols to follow. I also discussed how data should be handled and stored securely and in compliance with regulations.

<br/>

I am grateful for the opportunity to have participated as a trainer in an event of this kind, and I am pleased to know that the talks were well received by the attendees.
